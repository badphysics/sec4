\begin{problem}{1}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
  \item The sum of two numbers is 50 and their difference is 22. Find the numbers.
  \item One number is three times the other number. The difference between the two numbers is 12. Find the two numbers.
  \item The difference between the two numbers is 7. Two times the smaller number added to the larger number gives 22. Find the two numbers.
  \item Ten years ago, mother was 12 times as old as her daughter and ten years, hence she will be twice as old as her daughter will be. Find the present ages.
    \item Two hundred eighty-two people attended a recent performance of Cinderella. Adult tickets sold for \$5
and childrenâ€™s tickets sold for \$3 each. Find the number of adults and the number of children that attended
the play if the total revenue was \$1046. 
  \item The sum of two numbers is 14 and their difference is 2, find the numbers.
  \item In a two digit number. The units digit is thrice the tens digit. If 36 is added to the number, the digits interchange their place. Find the number.
    
  \item If twice the age of son is added to age of father, the sum is 56. But if twice the age of the father is added to the age of son, the sum is 82. Find the ages of father and son.
